Allow your users to subscribe to your FeedBurner Feed and AWeber auto-responder in one form.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to have users who subscribe to you FeedBurner feed automatically subscribe to your
AWeber auto-responder list as well? Now you can.

FeedWeber allows users to enter their email address and automatically subscribe to both
services with just one click.

Worried about spam complaints? Since AWeber subscriptions require verification before the user
is fully subscribed, users still have to double opt-in and follow all of the rules.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `FeedWeber` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the Widget to your sidebar where you want it and enter the configuration options.
